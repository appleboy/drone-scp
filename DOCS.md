The Scp plugin copy files and artifacts to target host machine via SSH. The below pipeline configuration demonstrates simple usage:

```yaml
pipeline:
  scp:
    image: appleboy/drone-scp
    host: example.com
    target: /home/deploy/web
    source: release.tar.gz
```

Example configuration with custom username, password and port:

```diff
pipeline:
  scp:
    image: appleboy/drone-scp
    host: example.com
+   username: appleboy
+   password: 12345678
+   port: 4430
    target: /home/deploy/web
    source: release.tar.gz
```

Example configuration with multiple source and target folder:

```diff
pipeline:
  scp:
    image: appleboy/drone-scp
    host: example.com
    target: 
+     - /home/deploy/web1
+     - /home/deploy/web2
    source: 
+     - release_1.tar.gz
+     - release_2.tar.gz
```

Example configuration with multiple host:

```diff
pipeline:
  scp:
    image: appleboy/drone-scp
-   host: example.com
+   host:
+     - example1.com
+     - example2.com
    target: /home/deploy/web
    source: release.tar.gz
```

Remove target folder before copy files and artifacts to target:

```diff
  scp:
    image: appleboy/drone-scp
    host: example.com
    target: /home/deploy/web
    source: release.tar.gz
+   rm: true
```

Example configuration for success build:

```diff
pipeline:
  scp:
    image: appleboy/drone-scp
    host: example.com
    target: /home/deploy/web
    source: release.tar.gz
+   when:
+     status: success
```

Example configuration for tag event:

```diff
pipeline:
  scp:
    image: appleboy/drone-scp
    host: example.com
    target: /home/deploy/web
    source: release.tar.gz
+   when:
+     status: success
+     event: tag
```

# Secrets

The SCP plugin supports reading credentials from the Drone secret store. This is strongly recommended instead of storing credentials in the pipeline configuration in plain text.

```diff
pipeline:
  scp:
    image: appleboy/drone-scp
    host: example.com
    username: appleboy
-   password: 12345678
    port: 4430
    target: /home/deploy/web
    source: release.tar.gz
```

The above webhook Yaml attribute can be replaced with the `SCP_PASSWORD` secret environment variable. Please see the Drone documentation to learn more about secrets.

It is highly recommended to put the `SCP_PASSWORD` or `SCP_KEY` into a secret so it is not exposed to users. This can be done using the drone-cli.

```bash
drone secret add --image=appleboy/drone-scp \
  appleboy/hello-world SCP_PASSWORD 12345678
drone secret add --image=appleboy/drone-scp \
  appleboy/hello-world SSH_KEY @path/to/.ssh/id_rsa
```

Then sign the YAML file after all secrets are added.

```bash
drone sign appleboy/hello-world
```

See [secrets](http://readme.drone.io/0.5/usage/secrets/) for additional information on secrets
